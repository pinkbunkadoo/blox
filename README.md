# What is it?

An early prototype for a 3d puzzle game.

## How do I try it?

Open the project in Unity or play the webGL version at http://pinkbunkadoo.github.io/omni/.

## How do I play?

- Drag the view to roll the cube - it will attempt to roll in the direction you drag.
- Roll onto symbol tiles to activate them.
- A symbol tile will activate when its symbol matches the symbol of the cube side facing it.
- Try to reach the exit (orange tile)
